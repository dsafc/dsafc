Democratic Socialists of America Fort Collins (DSAFC) is a local pre-organizing
committee of the [Democratic Socialists of America](https://dsausa.org), the largest
socialist organization in the US. The DSA is a national political organization
run democratically by members that seeks to build a mass movement and transfer
power from the ruling elite to the working class, and gain freedom and
democratic control over all aspects of society. With direct, grassroots action,
we are working to make democratic socialism a reality in Fort Collins, the
nation and the world.

Our chapter has several active campaigns:

- **[Medicare For All](https://medicareforall.dsausa.org/)** - In our fight for
universal healthcare for everyone, we host educational 'What is M4A?' events
and panel discussions, participate in local parades, and table at community
events. We're also working to get a M4A resolution passed by Fort Collins City
Council.

- **Education** - We host educational meetings on a variety of social and political
topics from a leftist point of view. Meetings include presentations by DSAFC
members and outside guests, documentary viewings, and group readings.

- **Food Justice** - The current distribution of food leaves many in our community
without access to healthy, nutritious meals and results in significant food
waste. We prepare and serve food to our community members every third Saturday
of the month at the [Fort Collins Mennonite Fellowship](http://www.fcmennonite.org/) and
support [Food Not Bombs](https://www.facebook.com/Food-Not-Bombs-Fort-Collins-1787637267968000/)'
weekly meal.

- **Elections** - We work to fight for justice and build working-class political
power through electoral means by researching, endorsing, and supporting
candidates, promoting legislation, and encouraging involvement in the electoral
political process at the local, state, and national level.

- **[Bernie Sanders](https://bernie.dsausa.org/)** - As part of the 'not me, us' mass
movement of working people, we host events, canvass, phonebank, and use other
tactics to bring democratic socialist politics to millions by electing Bernie
Sanders president.

- **Paid Leave** - We've teamed up with 9to5 Colorado and other Colorado DSA chapters
to fight for accessible, adequate, and affordable paid family medical leave in
Colorado.
