Democratic Socialists of America Fort Collins (DSAFC) is a local chapter of the [Democratic Socialists of America](https://dsausa.org), the largest
socialist organization in the US. The DSA is a national political organization
run democratically by members that seeks to build a mass movement and transfer
power from the ruling elite to the working class, and gain freedom and
democratic control over all aspects of society. With direct, grassroots action,
we are working to make democratic socialism a reality in Fort Collins, the
nation, and the world.

Our chapter has several active campaigns:

* [**Medicare For All**](https://medicareforall.dsausa.org/) - In our fight for
  universal healthcare for everyone, we host educational 'What is M4A?' events
  and panel discussions, participate in local parades, and table at community
  events. We're also working to get a M4A resolution passed by Fort Collins City
  Council.
* **Labor** - The Labor Organizing Committee works to support existing unions, organize new unions and fight for workers rights across Northern Colorado. We are currently focused on campaigns to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize or PRO Act and support workers in their struggle to organize new unions. Join us and lets build a strong, militant working class together.
* **Education** - We host educational meetings on a variety of social and political
  topics from a leftist point of view. Meetings include presentations by DSAFC
  members and outside guests, documentary viewings, and group readings.
* **Food Justice** - The current distribution of food leaves many in our community
  without access to healthy, nutritious meals and results in significant food
  waste. We prepare and serve food to our community members every third Saturday
  of the month at the [Fort Collins Mennonite Fellowship](http://www.fcmennonite.org/) and
  support [Food Not Bombs](https://www.facebook.com/Food-Not-Bombs-Fort-Collins-1787637267968000/)'
  weekly meal.
* **Elections** - We work to fight for justice and build working-class political
  power through electoral means by researching, endorsing, and supporting
  candidates, promoting legislation, and encouraging involvement in the electoral
  political process at the local, state, and national level.
